# light-dark_switch-Automator

my most recent project has been learning how to automate tasks on my laptop using Apple's Automator app for Mac

to get familiar with the workflow, I decided to write a script that would allow me to switch between light and dark mode while also swapping the wallpaper

I also made a video on how I did this, so you can check out the process if you'd like to replicate it for yourself!
